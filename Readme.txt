To Start
In your repos folder, find your Wardrobe project folder and right click it to COPY the folder (with the script and project in it).
PASTE the folder into the repos folder and it should name itself "Copy". Rename it to something like "WardrobeJS".
Go into that folder and, if there is a git folder there, delete that folder.
Create a new repository on GitHub for this project and initialize a new local repository in Git Bash to send to GitHub.
In your Solution, you may have to right click on the Project name (directly under the Solution name) and choose "Remove". After you choose this, right click on the Solution and choose "Add" and then "Existing Project". In that folder, click into the folder with the project name and choose the file that has the Type "Visaul C# Project". This should load all of the relevant files into your project.
If you have ANY problems with any of these steps, please see an instructor IMMEDIATELY
